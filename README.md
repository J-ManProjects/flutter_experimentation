# Flutter Experimentation
Experiment with Flutter to finally implement the EPR402 app.

## Background
The purpose of this app is to get a working Piano Roll Notation playback with synthesized audio. It also used a custom file manager to access desired CSV audio files (the future plan was to playback MIDI files).
